# ALSA
This project is about 
Electric vehicles are becoming much more of a common occurence nowadays and they will become more widespread with the advent of cheaper, more affordable techonologies, and the global push for sustainability of energy. However, the most common complaint about EV's is the charging issue. Gas stations are a fairly common sight to see all over the country as they have become a fairly routine standard of commute for many people. With how widespread the gas stations are, it becomes almost jarring for people when they suddenly lose access to the majority of the network once they make the switch to EV's. It plays a big factor in their viability as individuals not living in the metropolitan cities would most likely not have easy access to the charging stations. 
Here comes the ALSA app, using this website, users can see the nearby locations of the owners of EV's and by paying a minimal amount to the owners, the users can utilise the charging stations present in their homes and therefore have a much easier time travelling longer distances without worrying about running out of charge.
